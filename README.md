## Project Description
An AI-powered matchstick burnt detector that decides your fate:  
- **If burnt** ‚Üí Dramatic burning animation at the top panel, sending the stick out of the computer.  
- **If fresh** ‚Üí You play as the matchstick in a Jetpack Joyride‚Äìstyle game, dodging fire emojis and collecting points.

## The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
Nobody knows whether their matchstick is burnt or fresh after looking at it ‚Äî and they desperately need a fun way to find out.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a React-powered, pixel-art, AI-driven matchstick inspection system.  
It uses image detection to determine if your stick is burnt or not.  
If it‚Äôs burnt, we set it on fire (digitally). If it‚Äôs fresh, we send it into an arcade adventure.
